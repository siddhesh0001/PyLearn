# Take the 2 int number from user and we want to add them

num1 = input("enter the first number ")
num2 = input("enter the second number")
result = num1 + num2
print(result)
# in this it will print 12 as variable is string. And in will print the same what we enter
# it will work as conginated value
# so we have to convert it into integer
# below example is for addition after converting sting in to integer


num3 = input("enter the third number")
num4 = input("enter the fourth number")
result = int(num3) + int(num4)
print(result)
