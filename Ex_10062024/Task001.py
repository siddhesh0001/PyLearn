# Question no 1
# Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.
# Ans -->
#a = 5  --> In this  = to signe indicate that we are assigning a value to a variable
# If we use = then it will store that value in that variable

#a==4 --> In this if we use == equal to signe then it will check the value or verfiy the value if a is equal to 4 or not
# == signe will give ans in boolean ie True or false


#Question no 2

#What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?
#Ans -->
#** is used for power or exponentiation operation
# it will multiply given value one time then will multiply it again
#ie print(2**3) #it will print 8 because 2 to the power of 3 is 8

#Question no 3
#What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?

#Ans -->
# The bitwise XOR operation works as follows:
# For each bit position, if the bits of the operands are different, the result bit is 1.
# If the bits of the operands are the same, the result bit is 0.
