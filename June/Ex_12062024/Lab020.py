# Now we will learn While loop

i = 0
while i<5:
    print(i)
    i = i+1
#in this value of i is 0 in start
#then we are checking while 0 is less than 5, if yes then go to next line
# i is 0 then make it 0+1 then it will be 1
# now i value is 1 as we add 1 into 0
#now check if 1 is less than 5, if yes then go to next line
# i value is 1 then 1+1 is 2, now i is 2
#do it will 5
#now it will check if 5 is less than 5 then it is false, because both are equal
#then it will go out of loop and print 0 to 4
