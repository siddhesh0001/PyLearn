#Question no 1
#Develop a Python script that calculates the square and cube of a given number. num = 2 sq - 4, c = 8
#ans

num = 2
square = num ** 2
cube = num ** 3
print(f"The square of {num} is {square}")
print(f"The cube of {num} is {cube}")

#How to write it in one line
print(f"The square of {num} is {num**2} and the cube is {num**3}")

num =2
square = num ** 2
cube = num **3
print (square, cube)

#Question 2
#Create a program that takes two numbers as input and prints whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number.
#ans

num1 = input("Enter the 1st number")
num2 = (input("enter the 2nd number"))
print("num1 is greater" if num1 > num2 else "num2 is greater then num1" )
