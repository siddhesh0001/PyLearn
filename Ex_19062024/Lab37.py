#tuple - it is colletion of item
#it is same as list
#it is faster than list
#it is used when we don't want to change the value of the tuple
#list has [] and tuple has()

list = [1,2,3,4,5]
list[0] = 10
print(list)
#it will change the value of the list

# tuple = (1,2,3,4,5)
# tuple[0] = 10
# print(tuple)
#it will give error message that we cannot change the value

#else everthing is same as list
